# Unpooner
Replaces a user's profile picture on discord with another image.

Only works for the web version of discord, not the app.
Made only for Chrome. All other instances of Chrome have to be closed before launching the script for it to work.
It assumes you have Chrome downloaded on your C: disk with default settings.
